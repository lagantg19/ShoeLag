Shoelag
Welcome to the Shoelag project! Shoelag is an online platform where users can sign up, upload their shoes for sale, and explore a wide variety of shoes from other users. The platform requires shoe listings to be approved by an admin before they appear in the explore page, ensuring quality and authenticity for buyers.

Express.js: A web application framework used to handle server-side logic and API endpoints.
React: A JavaScript library used for building the user interface and frontend components.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used to run the server-side code.
